# WordPress Starter
This is simple starter skeleton repo for a WordPress developer and live site - reduce the `wp-config.php` for live sites. The `.htaccess` is optimized for performance and security topics.

## Description
* `wpbeta` as default name for the wp-directory; because i use the last nightly build for development
* WordPress as a Git submodule in `/wpbeta/`
* Custom content directory in `/wp-content/`
* Custom plugin directory in `/wp-plugins/`
* Custom multisite plugin directory in `/wpmu-plugins/`
* `wp-config.php` in the root
* Default as Multisite mode

## Installation
1. Clone the Starter to your webserver `git clone https://github.com/bueltge/WordPress-Starter.git`
2. You need to run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update --recursive` to pull the WordPress Core
3. Change the settings, in particular the database inside the `wp-config.php`
